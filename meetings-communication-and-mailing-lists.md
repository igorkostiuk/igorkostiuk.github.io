# Meetings, communication, and email

## Meetings

CERN uses different tools to arrange and conduct meetings and other types of communication.

### Indico

Stands for integrated digital conference. The website with complete list is here:

It is quite hard to find anything there if you don't have experience with it so it's good to start with 

#### **Meetings of the week** page:

{% embed url="https://indico.cern.ch/category/6734/overview?period=week" %}

You can change the settings to show other periods and the amount of info displayed.

#### Vidyo

Vidyo software is used for the meetings. It allows both video calls for multiple people and screen sharing:

Most of the communication is still done via email although mattermost is getting more popular

### Webmail

You can access CERN mail online here \(if you have applied for a CERN mail\):

### E-groups

To be in the loop it is useful to subscribe to the main mailing lists:

* davinci
* distributed analysis
* simulation
* **add more and with proper list names**

**When you search for a list make sure to choose "contains" if you don't know the parent list**
