# CERN basics

## Account settings

Let's start by configuring your new CERN account.

You can check if you are able to login at:

{% embed url="https://account.cern.ch/account/" %}

### AFS storage

From there you can go to My Accounts-Services-AFS Workspace-Settings and you will arrive here:

{% embed url="https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/AFS/Settings.aspx" %}

Now you can create your Workspace and increase its quota and also increase the quota of your home directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Note that AFS is being phased out soonâ„¢ so at some point you will need to move all your work to EOS
{% endhint %}

More info about AFS here:

### EOS storage

This is a newer type of storage which should be used for most of the things except ganga software \(ADD LINK\) which doesn't like it very much \(as of May 2019\). More on the starterkit page:

### GRID certificate

To use GRID for computing you have to get a certificate here:

{% embed url="https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/Accounts/Settings.aspx" %}

There is an extended FAQ here:

{% embed url="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/FAQ/Certificate" %}

ADD info about how to check quota \(maybe a separate page for grid/ganga/dirac\)

### LXPlus settings

Next, make sure you are a member of z5 group and choose the default shell. If you have never used one start with bash:

{% embed url="https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/Linux/Settings.aspx" %}

Now you can login to lxplus and check if everything is working. Check out the corresponding starterkit page:

{% embed url="https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit-lessons/first-analysis-steps/prerequisites.html" %}



### Email quota

After subscribing to a lot of mailing lists you may want to increase your mailbox quota at some point. You can do this here:

{% embed url="https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/EMail/Settings.aspx" %}

## Resources

### CERN document server \(TDRs, pictures, theses, papers...\)

Hosts a lot of stuff. Here you can find Technical Design Reports \(TDRs\) with descriptions of the detectors, papers, theses, internal and public notes. Also you can find official CERN pictures that you can use for your thesis:

### Overleaf

Overleaf is a commercial company that provides web-based hosting and creation of TeX \(LaTeX/XeTeX/LuaTeX\) documents. CERN users get a pro account automatically \(as of May 2019\):
