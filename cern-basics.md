# CERN basics

## Account settings

You can check if you are able to login at:

<https://account.cern.ch/account/>

### AFS storage

From there you can go to My Accounts-Services-AFS Workspace-Settings and you will arrive here:

<https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/AFS/Settings.aspx>

Now you can create your Workspace and increase its quota and also increase the quota of your home directory.

Note that AFS is being phased out soonâ„¢ so at some point you will need to move all your work to EOS

More info about AFS here:

<http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/afs-service>

### EOS storage

This is a newer type of storage which should be used for most of the things except ganga software \(ADD LINK\) which doesn't like it very much \(as of May 2019\). More on the starterkit page:

<https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit-lessons/first-analysis-steps/eos-storage.html>

### GRID certificate \(add grid quota check\)

To use GRID for computing you have to get a certificate here:

<https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/Accounts/Settings.aspx>

There is an extended FAQ here:

<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/FAQ/Certificate>

### LXPlus settings

Next, make sure you are a member of z5 group and choose the default shell. If you have never used one start with bash:

<https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/Linux/Settings.aspx>

Now you can login to lxplus and check if everything is working. Check out the corresponding starterkit page:

<https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit-lessons/first-analysis-steps/prerequisites.html>



### Email quota

After subscribing to a lot of mailing lists you may want to increase your mailbox quota at some point. You can do this here:

<https://resources.web.cern.ch/resources/Manage/EMail/Settings.aspx>

## Resources
